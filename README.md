# Baylor's Projects
Baylor's Projects is a repository full of python scripts, that I make in my freetime for fun.
## About me
Hi, my name is Baylor, and I'm 13 years old. I started this project because one summer, I was thinking, "What am I even gonna do with this much time?" Well, I decided to start learning Python, and a few other languages. After I got the hang of it, I decided I would release my scripts I made for fun to the public. I already knew a little about GitHub, so I figured that'd be a great place to start. And that's when I thought of [baylorprojects.com](https://baylorprojects.com). So I hopped on CloudFlare and registered a domain. And here we are now, writing this.
